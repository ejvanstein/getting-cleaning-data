1. Download the zip file (see link above)
2. Put `run_analysis.R` in a directory
3. Take these files from the zip file and put in the same directory as `run_analysis.R`:
	* `features.txt`
	* `subject_test.txt`
	* `subject_train.txt`
	* `X_test.txt`
	* `X_train.txt`
	* `y_test.txt`
	* `y_train.txt`
4. Ensure the reshape2 package is installed in R
5. Open `run_analysis.R` and change the directory on line 2 to match the directory where `run_analysis.R` is located
6. Run `run_analysis.R`, the output is `tidy.txt`
7. `CODEBOOK.md` contains information about `tidy.txt`
